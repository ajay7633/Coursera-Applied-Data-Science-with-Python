### This Project is a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST).

The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (MSSISS) have partnered with Detroit's City to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing blight ticket violations. The city issues blight violations to individuals every year,  and many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know how to increase blight ticket compliance?

My task was to create predictive modeling to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time or not.
