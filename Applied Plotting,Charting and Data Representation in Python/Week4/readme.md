The Figure shows the trend change in the NBA over the last 33 years.
In the earlier years, Teams were most likely to draft a center (or big man) but that tread changed over the last decade as more and more teams are more inclined to draft a guard or a forward. This is already a well-known fact as the average 3pt shot in-game has gone since the start of the NBA and is at an all-time high. But this study also confirms the fact that teams are more likely to pay a guard or forward than a big man.
Figure 1: Line Plot
It shows the trend in the mean Salary of position category over the 1985 -2018 seasons. The average Salary which dropped in recent years has picked up recently. This increase is ( anomaly) due to recent tv deals that have seen a spike in the pay of players, and most centers were able to get a bigger break.
Figure2: Scatter Plot
Shows a different study, where the highest-paid players in each season which were commonly bagged by centers have now taken by players in another category
Figure 3: Bar Chart
Shows the Number of players in each category in each season. Increased Centers (red) and recently number has been going down. Teams are more likely to draft any other category than a center.
